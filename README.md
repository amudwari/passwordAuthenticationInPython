In this project, I implement the password-based
authentication which is used in UNIX variants
 and other operating systems. Here unique salt 
 values were generated and the password file 
 is created to store user name, salt values,
  and hash code using MD5 hashing algorithm. 
  Then the password is verified using UNIX 
  password scheme and Rainbow Table Attack
   is performed using various rainbow tables.
